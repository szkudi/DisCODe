DisCODe - Distributed Component Oriented Data Processing 
========================================================

Introduction
------------

This project contains sources of DisCODe - a framework facilitating the development of sensorical data processing algorithms. DisCODE is written mostly in C++ (in an objective manner) and composing of a components library with patterns for their usage. Those patterns impose general implementation method diverse, multistage data processing algorithms.
