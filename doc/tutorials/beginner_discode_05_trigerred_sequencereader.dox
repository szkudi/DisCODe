\section ts_objectives Tutorial objectives
Modify the SequenceViewer.xml (task responsible for loading sequence of images from files and
displaying them one-by-one) by adding the Keyboard component in order to gain the possibility
to trigger the next image load, thus its display.

\section ts_structure Task structure
The structure of the TriggeredSequenceViewer task is shown below.

\htmlonly
<img src="images/TriggeredSequenceViewer.png" style="margin: 5px; width: 450px;" alt="TriggeredSequenceViewer"/>
\endhtmlonly

\note For more details regarding the structure please click <a href="images/Legend.png">here</a>.
\note The reason of the separate thread for the \ref Keyboard is explained in its description.

\section ts_file Task file
Create a new TriggeredSequenceViewer.xml file on the base of the previously created SequenceViewer.xml.
Modify required parts:
- Add the <b>Kbd1</b> component to a separate <b>Exec2</b> executor.
\code
	<Components>
		...
        <Kbd1 type="Keyboard" thread="Exec2" group="s1">
            <keys>t</keys>
        </Kbd1>
		...
\endcode
\note The list of keys contain only one key. This means that only the <b>t</b> button will raise adequate (<b>t_Pressed</b>) event.

- Set the <b>triggered</b> property of the <b>Seq1</b> component.
\code
		<Seq1 type="Sequence" thread="Exec1" group="s1">
			...
			<triggered>true</triggered>
			...
		</Seq1>
\endcode


- Create second executor and set the main thread component to <b>Kbd1</b>.
\code
	<Executors>
		...
		<Exec2 type="continuous">
			<main_component>Kbd1</main_component>
		</Exec2>
		...
\endcode

- Add event and event handler - thrown when the <b>t</b> button will be pressed and handled by the <b>onTrigger</b> connected handler.
\code
	<Events>
		...
		<Event source="Kbd.t_Pressed" destination="Sequence.onTrigger"/>
		...
\endcode

\section ts_result Result
A sequence of images  will be displayed. After an image will be shown application will wait for user
to enter the 't' (must be followed by <enter>) to load and display another.

\note Notice the problem of image refreshment - this will be solved in the next tutorial.
